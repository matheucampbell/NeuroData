# Stimulus Scripts
These are programs that are or have been used to provide stimulus for data collection sessions. If you're using one of the 
scripts, be careful to note which version you're using in the description session of your info object, which should be in
the latest commit message for the file.

If you want to add a script or update an existing script, checkout a branch in this repository, make your changes, commit
with the proper version number, and open a pull request for review.
